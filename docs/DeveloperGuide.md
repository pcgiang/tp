SoConnect is a **desktop app for SoC students to manage contacts of _Professors_ and _Teaching Assistants_,
as well as to keep track of noteworthy events, optimized for use via a _Command Line Interface (CLI)_** while still having
the benefits of a _Graphical User Interface (GUI)_.

This developer guide is targeted at current and potential developers and testers of the SoConnect project. The purpose of this guide is to outline the architecture and some implementation details of SoConnect, so that developers and testers are aware of how to navigate this project.

## **Acknowledgements**

* The Calendar UI is inspired by another team project - [AY2122S1 CS2103T-F13-3](https://ay2122s1-cs2103t-f13-3.github.io/tp/). However, the implementation of the calendar UI is largely our own, other than a few instances of code reuse from the [CalendarFX Quick Start](https://dlsc.com/wp-content/html/calendarfx/manual.html#_quick_start) page.

This section will cover the design considerations and implementations of the various components of SoConnect, and how each component is related to other components.

### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The Architecture Diagram given above explains the high-level design of the SoConnect App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W15-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W15-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the SoConnect app.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the app in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The Sequence Diagram below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `edelete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an _interface_ with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API _interface_ mentioned in the previous point).

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` _interface_ and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` _interface_. Other components interact with a given component through its _interface_ rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W15-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `UI` component:

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of several `UiPart` components, such as `ContactListPanel`, `EventListPanel`, `CalendarWindow` and the different components within `Other UI components`. The `Other UI components` contain the following classes: `HelpWindow`, `CommandBox`, `StatusBarFooter` and `ResultDisplay`. These classes are not drawn in the diagram for brevity.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. Only the `CalendarWindow` component uses the [CalendarFX](https://github.com/dlsc-software-consulting-gmbh/CalendarFX) dependency. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W15-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](hhttps://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W15-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/HelpWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* passes the user commands to the `Logic` component to be executed.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Contact` and `Event` objects residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W15-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `CAddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a contact).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("edelete 1-3")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `edelete 1` Command](images/EDeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `EDeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `CAddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `CAddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `CAddCommandParser`, `EDeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` _interface_ so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W15-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

![SoConnect Model Component](images/ModelClassDiagram.png)

The `Model` component,

* stores the SoConnect data i.e., all `Contact` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueContactList` object) and all `Event` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueEventList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Contact` and `Event` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Contact>` and `ObservableList<Event>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the lists change.
* stores a `ModelDisplaySetting` object (not shown in the diagram) which will affect how the contacts and events will be displayed to the user.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* stores a `ModelHistory` object (not shown in the diagram) which keeps track of all history instances  of SoConnect. This is to facilitate the `undo` and `redo` features.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components).

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** 

An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. 
It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Contact` and `Event` references. 
This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, 
instead of each `Contact` or `Event` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>
<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="350" />
</div>


### Storage component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W15-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* saves both address book data and user preference data in json format, and reads them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`).

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package. For example, the `Range` class, specified in [`Range.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W15-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/commons/core/range/Range.java) encapsulates a range of indexes that are used by the `EDeleteCommand` and `CDeleteCommand` classes in logic.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.


### Mark Contacts feature

This section details how the `cmark` command is implemented. This command allows the user to mark frequently used contacts, with the added feature of allowing the user to specify **more than one** contacts to mark. The marked contacts will appear at the **top** of the contact list and in **reverse order** in which their corresponding indexes are specified.

#### Implementation

Both `CMarkCommandParser` and `CMarkCommand` classes are involved in the execution of the `cmark` command.

The `parse` method inside the `CMarkCommandParser` receives the user input, extracts the required index(es). It then creates a new List of `Index`(es) objects that will encapsulate the indexes of the contacts to be marked.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">
:bulb: **Tip:** `CMarkCommandParser#parse` will throw a ParseException if the argument is empty, not an integer or is outside of the contact index range.
</div>

`CMarkCommandParser#parse` method will then return an `CMarkCommand` with the given List of `Index` object.

Given below is one example usage scenario and explains how the `cmark` feature behaves at each step. You may also refer to the sequence diagram below.

Step 1. The user enters `cmark 1 2` to mark the first and second contact displayed in the contact list. The arguments `1 2` are passed to the `CMarkCommandParser` through the `parse` method call.

Step 2. The user input `1 2` will be subjected to checks by `String#trim` to ensure that argument provided is not empty. `Parserutil#parseMarkIndexes` will check for invalid arguments and create a list of `Index` object(s).

Step 3. From this example, the List of `Indexes` created will contain two elements, both of which are `Indexes` and contain the integer value `1` and `2` respectively.

Step 4. A new `CMarkCommand` object is returned to the `LogicManager`.

Step 5. During the execution of the command, the `CMarkCommand` object gets the `filteredContactList` in the `Model` and gets the relevant contacts using the object created in step 3. For each contact identified, the command will check if the contact is originally marked, if so it will generate a message saying the particular contact is already marked. Otherwise, a new marked `Contact` containing the same details as the original contact is created and replaces the original contact in the `Model`. Thereafter, the list of contact in the model is rearranged using `Model#rearrangeContactsInOrder`, which will cause newly marked contacts to be placed at the top of the contact list.

Step 6. A `CommandResult` with all newly marked contacts is returned and will be displayed to the user.

#### Sequence Diagram

The following sequence diagram shows how the `cmark` feature works for the example above:

![CMarkSequenceDiagram](images/CMarkSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Activity Diagram

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when the `cmark` feature is triggered:

![CMarkActivityDiagram](images/CMarkActivityDiagram.png)

#### Design Considerations

**Aspect: Marking of contacts:**

* **Alternative implementation 1:** CMarkCommand that does not place newly marked contacts at the top of the list.
  * Pros: Easier to implement as there is no need to keep track of which contacts are marked and the order in which they are marked.
  * Cons: Users still have to scroll through the entire contact list to find the marked contact(s).
* **Alternative implementation 2 (current choice):** CMmark replaces newly marked contacts at the top of the contact list.
  * Pros: Easier for the users to differentiate the marked portion of the contact list from the unmarked portion.
  * Cons: Harder to implement as there is a need to keep track of the order in which the contacts is marked and rearrange the contact list after each `cmark` command.


**Aspect: Allowing users to specify more than one index:**

* **Alternative implementation 1:** Not allowing users to specify more than one index.
    * Pros: Easier to implement as there is no need to keep track of the order in which the indexes are specified.
    * Cons: User may have to scroll through or use `cmark` command to mark multiple contact(s).
* **Alternative implementation 2 (current choice):** Allowing users to specify more than one index.
  * Pros: Command is more efficient as users can mark more than one contact at the same time.
  * Cons: Harder to implement as more code is needed to facilitate the marking of multiple contacts in the correct order.


### Unmark Contacts feature

This section details how the `cunmark` command is implemented. This command allows the user to unmark marked contacts, with the added feature of allowing the user to specify **more than one** contacts to unmark. The marked contacts will appear after all marked contacts and **in order** in which their corresponding indexes are specified.

#### Implementation

Both `CUnmarkCommandParser` and `CUnmarkCommand` classes are involved in the execution of the `cunmark` command.

The `parse` method inside the `CUnmarkCommandParser` receives the user input, extracts the required index(es). It then creates a new List of `Index`(es) objects that will encapsulate the indexes of the marked contacts to be unmarked.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">
:bulb: **Tip:** `CUnmarkCommandParser#parse` will throw a ParseException if the argument is empty, contains invalid values or the contact at the specifed index is not initially marked.
</div>

`CUnmarkCommandParser#parse` method will then return an `CUnmarkCommand` with the given List of `Index` object.

Given below is one example usage scenario and explains how the `cunmark` feature behaves at each step. You may also refer to the sequence diagram below.

Step 1. The user enters `cunmark 4 5` to unmark the fourth and fifth **marked** contact displayed in the contact list. The arguments `4 5` are passed to the `CUnmarkCommandParser` through the `parse` method call.

Step 2. The user input `4 5` will be subjected to checks by `String#trim` to ensure that argument provided is not empty. `Parserutil#parseMarkIndexes` will check for invalid argument and create a list of `Index` from the argument.

Step 3. From this example, the List of `Indexes` created will contain two elements both of which are `Indexes` and contains the integer value `4` and `5` respectively.

Step 4. A new `CUnmarkCommand` object is returned to the `LogicManager`.

Step 5. During the execution of the command, the `CUnmarkCommand` object retrieves the `filteredContactList` in the `Model` and get the relevant contacts using the object created in step 3. For each contact identified, the command will check if the contact is not marked, if so a message saying the contact is not marked will be generated. Otherwise, a new unmarked `Contact` object containing the same details as the original contact is created and replaces the original contact in `Model`. Thereafter, the list of contact in the model is rearranged using `Model#rearrangeContactsInOrder`, which will cause newly unmarked contacts to be placed below all marked contacts in the contact list.

Step 6. A `CommandResult` with all newly unmarked contacts is returned and will be displayed to the user.

#### Sequence Diagram

The following sequence diagram shows how the `cunmark` feature works for the example above:

![CUnmarkSequenceDiagram](images/CUnmarkSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Activity Diagram

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when the `cunmark` feature is triggered:

![CUnmarkActivityDiagram](images/CUnmarkActivityDiagram.png)

#### Design Considerations

**Aspect: Unmarking of contacts:**

* **Alternative implementation 1:** CUnmarkCommand that does not replace newly unmarked contacts after all marked contacts.
  * Pros: Easier to implement as there is no need to keep track of which the newly unmarked contacts.
  * Cons: The marked contacts will no longer be at the top of the contact list, users would still have to scroll through the entire list of unmark and marked contacts to find a specific marked contact(s).
* **Alternative implementation 2 (current choice):** CUnmark replaces newly unmarked contacts below marked contacts.
  * Pros: Easier for the users to differentiate the marked portion of the contact list from the unmarked portion.
  * Cons: Harder to implement as there is a need to keep track of the order in which the contacts is unmarked and rearrange the contact list after each `cunmark` command.
   

**Aspect: Whether to allow users to specify more than one index:**

* **Alternative implementation 1:** Only allow users to specify one `Index`.
  * Pros: Easy to implement as the newly unmarked contacts is simply removed and added after all marked contacts.
  * Cons: The user may want to unmark multiple contacts, which result in having to call `cunmark` command multiple times.
* **Alternative implementation 2 (current choice):** Allow users to specify one or more `Index`(es).
  * Pros: This command is more efficient, users can now unmark more than one contacts at the same time, saving time from having to call `cunmark` repeatedly.
  * Cons: More code will have to be written in order to facilitate unmarking multiple contacts and ensuring they are rearranged in the correct order.
 
 
### Delete Events feature

This section details how an `Event` or multiple `Event` objects are deleted using the `edelete` command.

The `edelete` command allows users to delete a single or an inclusive range of consecutive events from the current event list shown on SoConnect. The user needs to specify either an `Index` or a `Range` of event(s) to be deleted. Such event(s) would be removed from the `EventListPanel` in the _GUI_.

#### Implementation

We will use an example command: `edelete 1-3`.

Given below is the usage scenario of the above example and explains how the `edelete` feature behaves at each step.

Step 1: The user enters the command `edelete 1-3` to delete the events at indexes 1, 2 and 3.

Step 2: The user input argument is passed to the `EDeleteCommandParser` object, which parses the input arguments and creates a `Range` object for the range .
`Range` object will only be created if the input arguments pass the checks of `ArgumentMultimap` and `ParserUtil` methods.

Step 3: This `Range` object is used to construct a new `EDeleteCommand` object. `EDeleteCommand` object is then returned to `LogicManager` to be executed.

Step 4: During the execution, the `EDeleteCommand` object repeatedly deletes each event from the most updated event list through the `Model#deleteEvent` method.
`Model#deleteEvent` method would then check if the event to be deleted is **linked to any contacts**.
If the event **has linked** contacts, `Model#deleteEvent` would **first unlink** the event and the linked contacts through `Model#unlinkContactsFromEvent` before deleting the event.
At the same time, a new list of `EventChanger` objects containing all the events to be deleted will be created.
The [Calendar UI implementation](#calendar-ui-feature) will discuss the use of this list.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tip:** 

If the user only specifies one `Index` for `edelete`, a `Range` object is created with the same start and end `Index`.
</div>

#### Sequence Diagram

The sequence diagram below shows how the execution of the example command flows:

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `edelete 1 - 3` Command](images/EDeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** 

The lifeline for `EDeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

#### Activity Diagram

The activity diagram below shows how the execution of the `edelete` command flows:

![EDeleteActivityDiagram](images/EDeleteActivityDiagram.png)

#### Design considerations

**Aspect: Type of user inputs:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Either a single Index or a Range can be specified.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: Unable to delete multiple ranges of events or events that are not ordered consecutively in the event list.

* **Alternative 2:** Allow a mixture of multiple single indexes and multiple ranges
  * Pros: Able to delete events more efficiently.
  * Cons: We must ensure that the order of delete of the events is correct. It is more complex to keep track of the events to be deleted.


### List Events feature

This section details how the `elist` command is implemented. This command allows the user to view all events, with the added feature of allowing the user to specify which _field_ to display. By default, all _fields_ will be displayed.

#### Implementation

As outlined in the [Logic component section](#logic-component), both `EListCommandParser` and `EListCommand` classes are involved in the execution of the `elist` command.

The `parse` method inside the `EListCommandParser` receives the user input, extracts the required prefix(es). It then creates a new immutable `EventDisplaySetting` object that will encapsulate the visibility of the various _fields_ for all events in the _GUI_.

* If no prefix is provided, the `parse` method will set all _fields_ of the `Event` class to be displayed. This is the default setting.
* If one or more prefix(es) is / are provided, `parse` will set the corresponding _field_(s) to be displayed,
  sets the rest of the _fields_ to be hidden.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">
:bulb: **Tip:** If values of prefixes given are not empty, `EListCommandParser#parse` throws a ParseException.
</div>

`EListCommandParser#parse` method will then return an `EListCommand` with the given `EventDisplaySetting` object.

Given below is one example usage scenario and explains how the `elist` feature behaves at each step. You may also refer to the sequence diagram below.

Step 1. The user enters `elist at/ end/` to display only the start and end timings of events. The arguments `at/ end/` are passed to the `EListCommandParser` through the `parse` method call.

Step 2. The user input `at/ end/` will be subjected to checks by methods from [`ArgumentMultimap`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W15-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/parser/ArgumentMultimap.java) to ensure that there are no incorrect arguments in the command. Examples of incorrect arguments include `1` or `at/3`.

Step 3. A `EventDisplaySetting` object is created based on the input arguments.
   * If there are no inputs, then the default `EventDisplaySetting.DEFAULT_SETTING` object is created.
   * Since there are inputs for this example, an `EventDisplaySetting` with the `willDisplay` _fields_ for `startDateTime` and `endDateTime` set to true. All other _fields_ will be set to false (hidden from the user). `isViewingFull` will be set to false, since this is not a `view` command.

Step 4. A new `EListCommand` object is returned to the `LogicManager`.

Step 5. During the execution of the command, the `EListCommand` object will set update the `EventDisplaySetting` of the `Model` to the object created in step 3. Thereafter, the event cards are re-rendered, which will cause the `EventListPanel` in the UI component to update all the `EventCard` elements to display the events based on the new display settings.

Step 6. A `CommandResult` with all events listed is returned and will be displayed to the user.

#### Sequence Diagram

The following sequence diagram shows how the `elist` feature works for the example:

![EListSequenceDiagram](images/EListSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Activity Diagram

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when the `elist` feature is triggered:

![EListActivityDiagram](images/EListActivityDiagram.png)

#### Design Considerations

**Aspect: Whether to allow hiding of specific _fields_:**

* **Alternative implementation 1:** EListCommand displays all _fields_.
    * Pros: No need to check for valid prefixes.
    * Cons: User may be interested in one _field_, but has to look through all the _fields_.
* **Alternative implementation 2 (current choice):** EListCommand allows users to choose which _fields_ to display.
  * Pros: User can choose to hide long details about the event and focus on the details important to them.
  * Cons: There is more room for mistakes, since it is more difficult to parse the user input correctly.

**Aspect: Changing the display settings of events:**

* **Alternative implementation 1:** Keep the settings directly in static fields in the `Event` class.
  * Pros: Easy to implement and it is possible to change the settings even in the parser.
  * Cons: It is difficult to test static variables since other tests may interfere with the state of the variables. Moreover, it will be impossible to implement a feature such as undo if the static fields are changed. This is unlike having a separate object like `EventDisplaySetting`, which is immutable and can be stored in history. In general, [manipulating global static variables is a bad idea](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7026507/why-are-static-variables-considered-evil).

* **Alternative implementation 2 (current choice):** Encapsulate the settings in a `EventDisplaySetting` class and update it in the `ModelManager`.
  * Pros: The settings are immutable so the implementation is less prone to errors.
  * Cons: More code will have to be written in order to facilitate the change in display settings.

### Link Event feature
This section details how an `Event` object is linked to one or more `Contact` objects using the `elink` command.

The `elink` command allows users to link an event to one or more contacts from the current event list and contact list shown in SoConnect.
The user needs to specify the `Index` of the event as well as the `Index` of the contacts to link. `Index` of the event must
come first, followed by that of contacts. To differentiate the `Index` of contact and event, the user needs to specify the
prefix `c/` right before every `Index` of the contact to be linked to the event.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">
:bulb: **Tip:** Each link between an event and contact results in them having a bi-directional relationship.
</div>

#### Implementation

The following operations are the main operations for `elink`.

- `ELinkCommandParser#parse` - Parse the user inputs and create a `ELinkCommand` object to return.

- `ELinkCommand#execute` - Links the event to the target contacts.

We will use an example command `elink 1 c/1 c/2 c/3`, together with a sequence diagram, to explain how the `elink` feature works.

#### Sequence Diagram

![ELinkSequenceDiagram](images/ELinkSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `ELinkCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Given below is the usage scenario from the example command `elink 1 c/1 c/2 c/3`, and explains how the `elink` feature behaves at each step.

Step 1: The user enters `elink 1 c/1 c/2 c/3` to link the event at index `1` to the contacts at indexes `1`, `2` and `3`.
The argument `1 c/1 c/2 c/3` are passed to the `ELinkCommandParser` through the `parse` method call.

Step 2: The argument `1 c/1 c/2 c/3` will be subjected to checks by methods from `ArgumentMultimap` and `ParserUtil` to ensure that there are no
incorrect arguments in the command. Examples of incorrect arguments include `1` or `c/2 1`.

Step 3: A [HashSet](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/util/HashSet.html) of type `Index`
containing the indexes of contact is created. The index of event and the HashSet(https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/util/HashSet.html) is passed as arguments to construct an
`linkCommand` object. `ELinkCommand` object is then returned to `LogicManager` to be executed.

Step 4: During the execution of the command, the `ELinkCommand` object links the event at index `1` to each of the contacts
through the `Model#linkEventAndContact` method call, by looping through the HashSet(https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/util/HashSet.html) containing the indexes of the contacts. 

Step 5. A `CommandResult` containing information about each link status will be displayed to the user.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">
:bulb: **Tip:** If a user attempts to link an event and contact
that were already linked, the command will succeed with a `CommandResult` to let user know instead of throwing a `CommandException`.

#### Activity Diagram

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when the `elink` feature is triggered:

![ELinkActivityDiagram](images/ELinkActivityDiagram.png)

#### Design Considerations
**Aspect: The relationship of the link:**

* **Alternative implementation 1:** The event has a reference to contacts that are linked to it but not the other way.
  * Pros: Easy to implement. We only need to manage the relationship of the link in `Event` object.
  * Cons: It is less efficient if we want to make changes to the contacts through other commands because we have to go through
  all events to find out which events have links to the contact.
    
* **Alternative implementation 2 (current choice):** Both event and contact have reference to each other if they are linked.
  * Pros: More efficient.
  * Cons: Have to enforce the bidirectional relationship strictly which is hard to implement and bug-prone.

**Aspect: Whether to update the existing contact/event objects to show the link:**

* **Alternative implementation 1:** Update the contact/event to have information about their linked events/contacts.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: `Contact` and `Event` objects are no longer immutable. Increase in difficulty of testing.

* **Alternative implementation 2 (current choice):** Creates new `Contact` and `Event` objects with link to each other and making them immutable.
  * Pros: Less likely to have bugs. Works well with other commands like `undo` and `redo` because any changes in the link
    will create new objects of `Contact` and `Event`, hence making it easier to store history of the contacts and events.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage because other commands like `EDeleteCommand` and `CEditCommand` may result in change in link relationship,
    resulting in the creation of new `Contact` or `Event` objects.


### Undo/redo feature

This section explains how `undo` and `redo` features are implemented. These features allow users to reverse the effect of
their previous command by using `undo`, and restore the previously undone action by using `redo`.

#### Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `ModelHistory`, stored internally as `allHistory`, an ArrayList of all `HistoryInstance` of addressBook.

![ModelHistoryDiagram](images/ModelHistory.png)

- `HistoryInstance` is a nested class inside `ModelHistory` which keeps track of the current state of `AddressBook` and its `ModelDisplaySetting`.
- `allHistory` is managed by two pointers `currentSize` and `maxSize`. `currentSize` indicates the current point in history, while `maxSize` indicates the last point of history. Both of these pointers will be initialized to 0 when the modelHistory is first created.
- `Model History` implements the following operations:
  * `commit()`â€‰â€”â€‰Saves the current history instance in the history.
  * `undo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores the previous history instance book state from its history.
  * `redo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores a previously undone history instance from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` _interface_ as `Model#commitHistory()`, `Model#undoHistory()` and `Model#redoHistory()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. A new model history will be initialized. The first version of `AddressBook` and `ModelDisplaySetting` will also create the first history instance in the history. Both current and maximum size of history will increment by one.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `edelete 5` command to delete the 5th event in the event list. The `edelete` command calls `Model#commitHistory()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `edelete 5` command executes to be saved in `allHistory` as a new history instance. Both `currentSize` and `maxSize` are incremented by 1, pointing to the newly inserted history instance.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `cadd n/David â€¦â€‹` to add a new contact. The `cadd` command also calls `Model#commitHistory()`, causing another modified state to be saved into `allHistory`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tip:** 
- If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitHistory()`, so the address book state will not be saved into `allHistory`.
- For general commands (help, exit, calendar, undo, redo), `Model#commitHistory()` will not be called as they do not cause any changes to addressBook.
</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the contact was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoHistory()`, which will shift the `currentSize` once to the left, pointing it to the previous history instance, and restores the address book and its displaySetting to that state. Pointer `maxSize` will not shift and will stay at the end point of the history.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tip:** If the `currentSize` is at index 0 or 1, it is pointing to an empty history or the initial HistoryInstance. Thus, there are no previous history instances to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#isUndoable()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the undo action.
</div>

#### Undo sequence diagram

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The `redo` command does the oppositeâ€‰â€”â€‰it calls `Model#redoHistory()`, which shifts the `currentSize` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book and its display setting to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tip:** If the `currentSize` is at the same point as `maxSize`, pointing to the latest history instance, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#isRedoable()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5.

- If the user decides to `redo` the previous `undo` command, the pointer `currentSize` will again be shifted forward by one, pointing to the last history instance. The previously undone addressBook state is restored.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

-  If the user instead executes another command such as `eclear`, this will call `Model#commitHistory()`. This will create a new history instance right after the current instance. Both `currentSize` and `maxSize` will be reset to point to this new instance. Any history instance following after will be ignored. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `cadd n/David â€¦â€‹` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

#### Activity diagram

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

![ActivityDiagram](images/UndoRedoActivityDiagram.png)

#### Design considerations

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book and its display setting.
    * Pros: Easy to implement.
    * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
    * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `cdelete`, just save the contact being deleted).
    * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

### Calendar UI feature

The calendar UI is implemented using the [CalendarFX](https://github.com/dlsc-software-consulting-gmbh/CalendarFX) framework. It can be opened using either the shortcut key `F2`, the file dropdown menu, or the command `calendar`. This feature is mainly facilitated by the `CalendarWindow` class. The `CalendarCommand` class handles the `calendar` command that the user may type and the `MainWindow` class handles the shortcut key and the dropdown menu option for showing the calendar.

#### Design of CalendarWindow

The `CalendarWindow` class extends from `UiPart`, just like the other UI components including the help window. The `CalendarWindow` class instance contains a table of events and the respective entries in the `Calendar` object. There are also final instances of `Calendar` and `CalendarView` objects in a `CalendarWindow` object. See the [CalendarFX manual](https://dlsc.com/wp-content/html/calendarfx/manual.html) for more information on `Calendar` and `CalendarView` classes.

![Sequence diagram of CalendarWindow](images/CalendarSequenceDiagram.png)

The sequence of how a calendar window is generated is shown in the UML sequence diagram above. The following are the textual descriptions of the diagram:

1. The user intends to open the calendar. The `MainWindow` object captures this intention and calls the constructor of `CalendarWindow` and passes the list of events into it.
2. The `Calendar` and `CalendarView` objects are created and stored. A _hashmap_ of `Event` objects to `Entry` objects is created. (Not shown)
3. A time thread is created to constantly update the current time of the calendar every 10 seconds.
4. The `Calendar` object is populated with the entries of events from Step 1. The _hashmap_ is also concurrently being updated with the events and the associated entries. (Not shown)
5. The `CalendarView` object is updated to include the `Calendar` object, and also to change some configurations to simplify the user interface and prevent edits directly on the calendar.
6. The `StackPane` (see [`CalendarWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W15-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/CalendarWindow.fxml)) is updated to include the new `CalendarView` user interface. The `CalendarWindow` object is now created and returned to `MainWindow`.

#### Design considerations

The user may leave the calendar window open and type in a new command to add, delete, edit or clear the events. In that case, there is a need to constantly update the calendar to reflect the new changes the user has made. This section discusses the implementation of the update and how the updates are optimized.

**Aspect: How the calendar is updated constantly:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Only updates the event(s) changed by the event commands.
    * Pros: More optimized and faster update for large number of events.
    * Cons: Harder to implement and prone to errors.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">
:information_source: **Note:** It is important to discuss the `EventChanger` class from `Model` since the implementation of the update feature depends heavily on this class.
</div>

The `EventChanger` class contains references to up to 2 `Event` objects - an `oldEvent` and a `newEvent`. It also contains a boolean that is true if the user intends to clear all events. Creating the `EventChanger` object to be passed to the `CalendarWindow` to update the entries is simple, as it can be easily constructed using one of the _factory methods_: `addEventChanger`, `clearEventChanger`, `deleteEventChanger` and `editEventChanger`. See the class diagram below for a summary of the `EventChanger` class.

![Class Diagram of EventChanger](images/EventChangerClassDiagram.png)

Upon the execution of any command, the list of event changers is returned in the `CommandResult`. The list is usually empty, except for the 4 types of commands listed above. The `updateCalendar` method of `CalendarWindow` is then called, which will update the `Calendar` object to remove the `oldEvent` and add the `newEvent` entries. The `Calendar` is cleared if the `EventChanger` is the `clearEventChanger`. This is when the _hashmap_ becomes useful, since the `Entry` objects in the calendar are unique and having the same `Event` associated to the `Entry` does not make the `Entry` objects equal. This will allow deletion of the `Entry` from the calendar.

* **Alternative 2:** Create a new Calendar with all the events for each command executed.
    * Pros: Easy to implement, less code is needed.
    * Cons: Performance can be slowed down if there are many events, even if the user does not make any large change to the events.

This alternative implementation will cause the `MainWindow` class to constantly query the event list in the `AddressBook` through the `Logic` manager every time a command is executed. The queried list is then used to create a new `Calendar` which will be used by the `CalendarWindow` object to display the calendar to the user. However, the performance cost is not feasible if there are many events stored in the `AddressBook`.

2.  Should be able to hold up to 1000 contacts without a noticeable sluggishness in performance for typical usage.
3.  A user with above average typing speed for regular English text (i.e. not code, not system admin commands) should be able to accomplish most of the tasks faster using commands than using the mouse.
4. Should not depend on Internet connection.
5. Only one user should be able to use the system at one time.

### Glossary

* **Mainstream OS**: Windows, Linux, Unix, OS-X.


* [**Main Success Scenario**](https://nus-cs2103-ay2122s1.github.io/website/schedule/week7/topics.html#requirements-specifying-requirements-use-cases-details) (MSS): Describes the most straightforward interaction for a given use case, which assumes that nothing goes wrong. 


* **Command Line Interface** (CLI): Text-based user interface.


* **Graphical User Interface** (GUI): Graphic-based user interface.


* **Interface**: (For user interface) The place at which independent and often unrelated systems meet and act on or communicate with each other/ a way for the user to interact with the system. (For other use of interfaces such as `Model`) See the [Java Tutorials](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/concepts/interface.html) for more details on what an interface in Java means.


* **Telegram handle**: Username of a [Telegram](https://telegram.org/) user.


* **Professor** (Prof): A lecturer who teaches a module in NUS.


* **Teaching Assistant** (TA): A student tutor employed to teach small group lessons in NUS.


* **Contact information**: Name and email of the contact. Phone number, address, telegram handle, video conferencing meeting link, and tag(s) are optional.


* **Field**: A particular detail of an event or contact. Examples of fields include the name of a contact, the description of an event or the tags of an event.


* **Hashmap**: A data structure that stores a table of keys and their corresponding values. In the implementation of Calendar UI, a hashmap is used to store the `Event` objects as keys and the `Entry` object as values.


* **Factory method**: A method to create an object without specifying the exact class, based on the creational design pattern. In the context of `EventChanger`, the factory methods create instances of subclasses of `EventChanger`, as seen in [`EventChanger.java`](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2103T-W15-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/event/EventChanger.java).
